## Pitch
*Protect the Vaccine* is a game where the scientist has to protect the vaccine on the table
from the zombies spawning from all 4 sides of the screen. If any of the zombies touch the scientist or the vaccine,
the vaccine will be contaminated, thus, ending the game. The scientist will shoot their laser to kill the zombies. 
There is a random chance the zombie will drop a special item when killed. Overtime, the zombies will scale 
in difficulty: faster, stronger, and special abilities. When the timer runs out and all the zombies are dead, 
the player wins.

### Phase 1
#### YOUTUBE LINK: https://youtu.be/2cLohY3uw3Y
- [x] <b>Create Game</b>: Create the square grid where the game takes place
- [x] <b>Scientist Exists</b>: There is a scientist on screen
- [x] <b>Scientist Moves</b>: move up, down, left, and right when the user presses 'W', 'S', 'A', and 'D' respectively
- [x] <b>Laser</b>: When the user hits the space bar, a laser comes out. Laser disappears when it hits offscreen
- [x] <b>Limit Screen</b>: Scientist cannot walk offscreen
- [x] <b>Zombie Appears</b>: There is a zombie that spawn randomly from all 4 sides of the screen

### Phase 2
- [x] <b>Laser Direction</b>: Laser shoots the direction the scientist faces
- [x] <b>Zombie Disappears</b>: The zombies disappear when they are hit by the laser
- [x] <b>Laser Disappears</b>: Laser disappears when it hits a zombie
- [x] <b>Create Vaccine</b>: Create the vaccine in the middle of the screen
- [x] Make it so that the scientist cannot walk over the vaccine
- [ ] <b>Zombie Follows</b>: The zombies follow the scientist or the vaccine (whichever is closer)
- [ ] <b>Game Pauses</b>: If the zombie touches the scientist or the vaccine, the game pauses

### Phase 3
- [ ] <b>Item Drop</b>: Create a random chance the zombies will drop a special item (make the player faster, bigger lasers)
- [ ] <b>Timer</b>: Add the timer
- [ ] <b>Timer runs out</b>: When timer runs out, a "You Won" screen appears
- [ ] <b>Score Increase</b>: Add a score that increases every 10 seconds
- [ ] <b>Game Over Screen</b>: Add the "Game Over" screen displaying time and score
- [ ] <b>Display Stats on Screen</b>: Display the score and time left
- [ ] <b>Scale</b>: As timer runs out, increase difficulty (faster zombies, need to be hit multiple times)
- [ ] <b>Shoot Lasers Diagonally</b>: When holding multiple keys, bullets can be shot diagonally
